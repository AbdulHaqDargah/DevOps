## Environment & Tooling Notes

- Repository managed using GitHub + Git on WSL (Ubuntu 20.04)
- Encountered and resolved WSL + Windows filesystem case-sensitivity issues during repo renaming
- Learned correct handling of:
  - Git remotes vs local folder names
  - Case-only renames on Windows-backed filesystems
