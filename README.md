# DevOps Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured, hands-on journey into DevOps engineering.

The goal is to build strong fundamentals first, then layer automation, cloud, and CI/CD on top — while documenting real progress, mistakes, and fixes along the way.

This is a **learning-by-doing** repository.

## What to Expect

You will find:
- Week-by-week learning structure
- Hands-on scripts, configs, and notes
- Clear progression from Linux basics to advanced DevOps topics
- Real problems faced during setup, tooling, and usage
- Practical understanding, not copied tutorials

Each week focuses on a specific theme and contains:
- A week-level README with progress summary
- Day-wise folders with actual work
- Scripts and artifacts created during learning

## What NOT to Expect

You will NOT find:
- Polished production-ready projects
- Step-by-step beginner tutorials
- Perfect or optimized solutions
- Copy-pasted blog or course material
- “Hello World” style examples

Mistakes, dead ends, and fixes are part of the process and are intentionally preserved.
