# Day 2 — Users, Groups, and Permissions Notes

- Created multiple Linux users using adduser.
- Observed how user home directories are structured.

- Learned the difference between:
  - User (owner)
  - Group
  - Others

- Practiced file permissions:
  - 600 → private file
  - 660 → owner + group read/write
  - 664 → owner read/write, group read-only

- Verified permissions using:
  - stat filename

- Practiced password reset and sudo boundaries.

Key takeaways:
- Ownership and permissions are the foundation of Linux security.
- Even root access can be restricted with proper controls.
