# Day 1 — Linux Basics Notes

- Learned how to navigate the filesystem using:
  - pwd, ls, cd, ls -la

- Created and executed a Bash script:
  - system_info.sh

- Understood that every command runs as a process.

- Fixed an issue where my script was accidentally running recursively.

Key takeaways:
- Bash is not just a terminal, it is a programming environment.
- Small scripts are a powerful way to document system state.
